## Lambda Notes
The following is a list of items that you will need to accomplish to demonstrate mastery over your 4th Lambda School Unit.

## Backend MVP Features:

We recommend that you finish all the MVP features before trying to deploy.

- Add data persistence using a Relational Database. We suggest you start with `SQLite3`.
- Create a Web API for the kind of React application you would have built in Unit 2 and 3.
- Build endpoints for each of the following features:
  - Display a list of notes.
  - Create a note with a _title_ and _content_.
  - View an existing note.
  - Edit an existing note.
  - Delete an existing note.

Upon your first commit, please submit a Pull Request and add _both_ the **Trello Set Up** and **Backend MVP Features** Task lists to your first Pull Request comment.

---

**Once you have completed the "Minimum Viable Product" requirements, message Edd for approval**. If approved, you may continue to deploy and work on the Extra Features. Please add the Extra Features you implement to the list you added to the comment on your first PR.

## Deployment

We recommend you deploy your server to [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#introduction).

Additionally, it is recommended that you keep your front end and backend codebases in separate GitHub repositories. This helps with deploying, since the different parts of your application will be deployed on different platforms.

## Extra Features:

Once your MVP has been approved, you have been given a feature list that the client would love to have completed. Your goal would be to finish MVP as soon as you can and get working the list of extra features.

- Setup Auto-Deploy on Heroku
- Provide documentation for how to interface with your API.
- Create and display tags that can be added to notes and stored in the Database.
- Allow users to clone notes.
- Search functionality.
- Create a Registration Page that allows users to create accounts for your app and sign in with email/password.
- Allow users to sign in with a third party service (google, facebook, github, club penguin, etc...)
- Allow users to create Lists and assign notes to a list.
- Allow users to attach images to notes.
- Allow multiple users to collaborate on notes.
- Add Unit and Integration Tests.

## Super Duper Extra Credit Bonus Features

- Add a payment form integrating with _Stripe_ that allows Users to buy a _"Premium"_ version of Lambda Notes.
- Gate your favorite feature behind the _premium_ paywall

You will notice that this repository does not have any starter code. This is on purpose. You are to start from scratch using any files you have built throughout your time here at Lambda School as reference.
